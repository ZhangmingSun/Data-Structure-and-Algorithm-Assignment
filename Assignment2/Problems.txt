==============================================================================
1. Given an array of size n, it has some numbers in it.  Write a program that returns TRUE if the array is a Binary Search Tree, or FALSE if it is not BST.
     Run this program 2 times.  First run would be for an array that is not a BST and it returns false. The second run the array is a BST and it returns true..


==============================================================================
2. We did Binary search algorithm in the class.  Modify it to do Tertiary search.  So your program will divide the array into 3 parts (instead of 2) in order to search for the item. Remember the array is sorted. The program should be RECURSIVE.
Run our program to search as follows:
     a. Number is the first item in the array
     b. Number is the last item in the array
     c. Number is somewhere in the array (not first or last item)
     d. Number not in the array.
Each time you will also print the array items.  



Submit the code and the screen shot of each run.
